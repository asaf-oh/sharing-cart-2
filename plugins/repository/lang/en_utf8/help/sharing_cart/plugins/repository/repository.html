<h1>Repository</h1>

<p>The Sharing Cart block (release 6 or later) can upload and download
Moodle activities/resources directly from a Moodle Repository.
The "Download from Repository" button will download already-chosen resources from a new site
built for Moodle for Language Teaching by Version2 Web Development.
In the future, there may be more repository sites available.</p>
